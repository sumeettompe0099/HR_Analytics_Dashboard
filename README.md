3)DATA LOADING:- The transformed data was loaded into Power View for further analysis.

4)DATA MODELLING:- Created A logical structure of data through data modelling process,enabled effective analysis and visualization.

5)DAX IMPLEMENTATION:- Refined the data using Data analysis expressions(DAX) to create calculated measure and columns for advance analysis.
